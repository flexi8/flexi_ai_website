    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Dexy is a cutting-edge AI assistant designed to break through the traditional limitations of smart home systems and virtual assistants. Built to operate seamlessly in the present, Dexy combines voice control, facial recognition, and contextual awareness to provide a personalized, efficient, and secure user experience.</p>
  </section>

 <section>
    <h2>Why Dexy?</h2>
    <p>Created by Flexi, the visionary behind the revolutionary Lexie AI AC system, Dexy represents the next bold step in personal and home-based artificial intelligence. Where Lexie focuses on cooling, comfort, and faith-inspired companionship, Dexy takes the idea further—integrating full-room environmental awareness, multi-device orchestration, emotional responsiveness, spiritual depth, and next-gen voice and facial interaction. It’s not just a smart home system—it’s an intelligent presence in your home.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>How Dexy Works</h2>
    <p>Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms and sensor integration, Dexy learns user preferences over time to anticipate needs and automate routine tasks. It leverages GPS location access and gospel attributes to provide uplifting messages and relevant notifications tailored to your environment.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Special Effects</h2>
	<p>What truly makes Dexy special is its integration of purpose. Where other AIs focus on entertainment or automation, Dexy focuses on transformation. It’s built to serve, to enhance, and to elevate human life. Whether it’s leading worship in the background, keeping your family safe, or organizing your day, Dexy’s intelligence is aimed at your flourishing.<p>
    <p>Dexy’s interface includes dynamic animations, voice modulation, and mood-responsive lighting to create an engaging and intuitive interaction experience. It supports multi-language commands and integrates smoothly with a variety of smart devices.</p>
 <p>At the core of Dexy’s breakthrough performance is a Raspberry Pi unit combined with a network of room-specific smart modules. Every room in a Dexy-enabled home becomes a node in a thinking, feeling environment. These modules are equipped with microphones, cameras, light sensors, temperature detectors, and speakers. They sync through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or local networks, creating a seamless, interactive experience no matter where you go in your home.<p>
 </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Dexy vs Chromist</h2>
	<p>Dexy takes on tech giants like Google Nest, Alexa, and Samsung SmartThings—but it does so with something they lack: soul. While Chromist and similar systems depend heavily on internet access, Dexy is designed to be semi-independent. It works offline, pulls data from pre-synced libraries, and communicates across its modules without cloud dependency. This means Dexy is usable even in homes with poor or inconsistent internet service—a vital advantage in many regions around the world.<p>
    <p>Unlike Chromist, which focuses mainly on media control and basic automation, Dexy offers advanced AI-driven personal assistance with a focus on spiritual enrichment, security, and contextual intelligence, making it the next generation AI living fully in the present.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Gospel Attributes & Location Access</h2>
    <p>Dexy includes unique gospel-based attributes, offering motivational scriptures and prayers tailored to user mood and time of day. Location services help deliver community-specific updates and support outreach efforts worldwide.</p>
  </section>

 <section>
    <h2>The Pontential Of Dexy</h2>
    <p>Dexy doesn’t just compete—it conquers. It doesn’t just respond—it relates. It doesn’t just automate—it understands. It’s not just “smart”—it’s wise.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Cost of Dexy</h2>
    <p>In terms of cost, Dexy is surprisingly affordable considering its powerful potential. A full system—including Raspberry Pi, camera modules, microphones, speaker modules, motion sensors, and app access—currently ranges from $350 to $700. That cost can be adjusted depending on how many rooms you want to cover and how advanced the AI responses need to be. DIY builders can go even lower if they already own components. The key point is this: you don’t need to be wealthy to experience next-gen AI. You just need the vision—and Dexy does the rest.</p>
